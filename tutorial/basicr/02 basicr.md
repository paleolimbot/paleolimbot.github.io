In the last lesson we covered **expressions**, **variables**, **functions**, **vectors**, and **indexing**, so now we're ready to learn about **control structures**, or the **if**, **else**, and **for** and **while** statements that let us control which code gets executed when. Finally, we'll learn about how to create our very own **functions**.

## Operators

To be able to control which code gets executed when, we're going to need to be able to preform tests that return a `TRUE` or a `FALSE`. The operators R provides are what you would expect: they test for equality, inequality, greater than, less than, or if a vector contains an item (among others).

(Code)

Here is a summary of the most common operators.
